## Usage 

Not all of the CRUD functions work to completion at the moment. The switch-board works and pushes the user to the proper functions, but the functions connecting to the SQL CRUD does not work on all aspects...I got lost in the weeds a bit on this. With so many things happening for this app, I pulled myself into too many directions
